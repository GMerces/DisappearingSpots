# DisappearingSpots
Macro designed to detect single molecule fluorescent spots and track intensity over time, including detection of intensity drop-off. Created in collaboration with Simone Pelliciari for submission of academic manuscript.

To use the macro, make sure FIJI is installed and up to date on your system. Download the macro file and open within FIJI's macro editor window. Run the code using the "Run" button.

When asked to select your home folder, you may select any folder in existance, or create a new one. This will be the location that the macro saves any intermediary images and output data (ROIs and save files). When selecting your raw images file, it is beneficial to have your files in ".tif" format to allow for smooth running of the macro without manual user input. The macro will run unless and error is reached.
